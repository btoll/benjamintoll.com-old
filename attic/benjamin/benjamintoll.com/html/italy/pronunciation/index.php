    <p>This guide serves as a very brief introduction to the pronunciation of the Italian language. It is no way intended to be comprehensive.</p>
    <h4>Note on pronunciation:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The accent ( <strong>'</strong> ) precedes the stressed syllable</li>
      <li><strong>L'albergo</strong> [al'bergo] is pronounced as alBERgo.</li>
      <li><strong>Il gomito</strong> ['gomito] is pronounced as GOmito.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Vowels:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A</strong> - sounds like <em>a</em> in f<em>a</em>ther or <em>o</em> in b<em>o</em>ther</li>
      <li><strong>E</strong> - has two sounds: like <em>e</em> in B<em>e</em>n or <em>ai</em> in h<em>ai</em>r</li>
      <li><strong>I</strong> - &nbsp;sounds like <em>i</em> in mach<em>i</em>ne or <em>ee</em> in b<em>ee</em></li>
      <li><strong>O</strong> - has two sounds: like <em>o</em> in d<em>o</em>ze or <em>o</em> in l<em>o</em>st</lik>
      <li><strong>U</strong> - sounds like <em>e</em> in l<em>e</em>wd or <em>oo</em> in m<em>oo</em>d</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tips:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Italian vowels are always articulated in a sharp, clear fashion, regardless of stress; they are never slurred or pronounced weakly.</li>
      <li>Vowels (a,e,i,o,u) always retain their value in diphthongs.</li>
      <li>Italian is a phonetic language, which means that it is spoken the way it is written. Italian and English share the Latin alphabet, but the sounds represented by the letters often differ considerably in the two languages.</li>
    </ol>
