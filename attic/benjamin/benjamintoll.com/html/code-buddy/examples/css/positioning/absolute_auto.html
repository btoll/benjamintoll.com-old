<p>Elements can be positioned outside their containing block.  This is similar to the way in which floated elements can use <span>[1]</span>negative margins to float outside of their parent’s content area.  It also suggests that the term "containing block" should really be "positioning context".</p>

<p>The idea behind positioning is fairly simple.  It allows you to <span>[2]</span>define exactly where element boxes will appear relative to where they would ordinarily be – or relative to a parent element, another element, or even to the browser window itself.</p>
