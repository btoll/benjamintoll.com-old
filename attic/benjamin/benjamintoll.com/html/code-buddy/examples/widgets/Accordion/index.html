    <p>We all know the problems that arise when we try to build multi-column layouts in which the columns are of equal height. It has been well documented elsewhere, so I won't go into the details here.</p>

    <p>A project I recently worked on required an elastic layout with two columns of equal height, each with a different background color. As usual, there was no way to tell which column would be taller. I immediately thought of Dan Cederholm's Faux Columns, but I needed an elastic layout. I also looked at the One True Layout, but this seemed buggy and required too much extra markup and too many hacks for my taste. I even thought about using JavaScript to make sure the columns were of equal height, but that just felt wrong. Out of desperation, I almost (gasp!) used a table.</p>
