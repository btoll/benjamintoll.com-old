    <h3 id="item1">Understanding the Compiler</h3>
    <p>The compiler is a software program that directly translates source code or some intermediary representation such as bytecode into machine code that can be executed by the computer's CPU. Compiled code is the most efficient and fastest way that a program can be run. A compiler performs beneficial operations such as optimization, lexical analysis, preprocessing and parsing, et. al. The most common reason for wanting to use a compiler is to create an executable program.</p>
    <p>Another function of the compiler is known as linking. A linker is a program which takes one or more objects generated by a compiler, &quot;links&quot; them to pre-compiled code and combines them into a single executable program.</p>

    <h3 id="item2">Understanding the Interpreter</h3>
    <p>An interpreter is simply a software program that executes or performs instructions written in a programming language. These instructions can be in the form of source code or bytecode (or some other form of intermediary representation) - an interpreter can compile source code to bytecode, for instance. An interpreter must step line-by-line through a program when executing it at runtime, and as such can be significantly slower than a compiled language. Intrepeted languages are executed by a virtual machine.</p>
    <p>An over-simplification is that an interpreter compiles the source code to bytecode, spawns a virtual machine, and then that virtual machine executes the bytecode. The interpreter can also be single- or multi-threaded, depending on the developer who wrote the interpreter.</p>

    <h3 id="item3">Understanding Bytecode</h3>
    <p>Bytecode is an intermediate representation between source code and machine code that's a more efficient, higly-optimized and compressed version of source code. For example, source code could be compiled into bytecode which would then be interpreted by a virtual machine, such as a bytecode interpreter. The bytecode also is highly portable as it's hardware agnostic. It's also possible that the bytecode could be further compiled into machine code at runtime by a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, although the machine code would then not be portable across systems.</p>

    <h3 id="item4">Interpreted and Compiled Languages</h3>
    <p>High-level languages such as JavaScript, Python, Perl and PHP, et. al. are interpreted languages as they are not compiled into machine code of the computer it is on. Rather, they are usually compiled into an intermediary representation such as bytecode that is then executed by a virtual machine as machine code (although some languages do further compilation using a JIT at runtime).</p>
    <p>On the other hand, low-level languages such as C, Fortran, BASIC and Cobol, et. al. are viewed as compiled languages as they are usually translated (compiled) directly into machine code. This compilation creates an executable program whose encoded instructions can be ran by the CPU as opposed to having to be parsed by an interpreter (such as what happens at runtime for a non-compiled program).</p>

    <h3 id="item5">More on Virtual Machines and JIT</h3>
    <p>The definition of a virtual machine is a software implementation of a machine (computer) that executes programs like a physical machine. There are two major categories of virtual machines; a system virtual machine and a process virtual machine. For the purposes of this post, we're only concerned with the latter.</p>
    <p>Designed to only run a single program, a process virtual machine supports a single process. When the process is started it is created, and it is destroyed when the process is exited. And an essential characteristic of a virtual machine is that the software running inside is limited to the resources and abstractions provided by the virtual machine. It cannot break out of its virtual world. Its sole purpose is to create an environment within the host machine that is platform-independent and that abstracts away all the details of the underlying hardware, allowing the program to execute the same no matter the host environment or platform.</p>
    <p>Virtual machines are separate from the interpreter in languages like Java but are the same in languages like Python.</p>
    <p>Process VMs are implemented using an interpreter; performance comparable to compiled programming languages is achieved by the use of just-in-time compilation.</p>
    <p>Built upon a previous idea of bytecode compilation, JIT converts code at runtime prior to executing it natively as machine code. Some of the benefits of JIT is that it has advantages over statically compiling the code as it can recompile the code at runtime (dynamic linking rather than static linking), and it has advantages over interpreters as it can cache the results of translating blocks of code rather than re-evaluating the program line-by-line.</p>
