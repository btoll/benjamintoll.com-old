<h2>JavaScript Implementations</h2>
<p>Although ECMAScript is an important standard, it is not the only part of JavaScript, and certainly not the only part that has been standardized. Indeed, a complete JavaScript implementation is made up of three distinct parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Core (ECMAScript, standardized by ECMA in a standard called ECMA-262)</li>
  <li>The Document Object Model (DOM, standardized by the W3C)</li>
  <li>The Browser Object Model (BOM, has not been standardized)</li>
</ul>

<h2>ECMAScript</h2>
<p><em>ECMAScript</em> doesn't have ties to any browser in particular, and, actually has no methods for user input or output to speak of (it is not unlike languages such as C, which rely on external libraries to accomplish such tasks). So what is ECMAScript? ECMA-262 (p.2) describes it like this:</p>

<blockquote>ECMAScript can provide core scripting capabilities for a variety of host environments, and therefore the score scripting language is specified...apart from any particular host environment.</blockquote>

<p>A web browser is considered a host environment for ECMAScript, but it is not the only host environment. Indeed, numerous other environments (such as Nombas's ScriptEase and Macromedia's ActionScript, used in both Flash and Director MX) can host ECMAScript implementations. So what does ECMAScript specify outside of a browser? To put it simply, ECMAScript describes the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax</li>
  <li>Types</li>
  <li>Statements</li>
  <li>Keywords</li>
  <li>Reserved words</li>
  <li>Operators</li>
  <li>Objects</li>
</ul>

<p>ECMAScript is simply a description, defining all the properties, methods, and objects of a scripting language. Other languages implement ECMAScript, as JavaScript does, as the baseline for functionality.</p>
