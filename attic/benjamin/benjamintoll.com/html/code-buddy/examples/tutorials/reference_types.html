<h2>Primitive types and reference values</h2>
<p>In ECMAScript a variable can hold one or two types of values; primitive values and reference values.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Primitive values</em> are simple pieces of data that are stored on the <em>stack</em>, which is to say that their value is stored directly in the location that the variable accesses.</li>
  <li><em>Reference values</em>, on the other hand, are objects that are stored in the <em>heap</em>, meaning that the value stored in the variable location is a <em>pointer</em> to a location in memory where the object is stored.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Primitive Types</h3>
<p>ECMAScript has five <em>primitive</em> types: Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number and String. ECMA-262 defines the term <em>type</em> as a set of values, and each of the primitive types defines a range of values it can contain as well as literal representations of that type. To determine if that value is in the range of values for a particular type, ECMAScript provides the <code>typeof</code> operator. This operator can be used to determine if a value represents a primitive type and, if so, which primitive type it represents.</p>

<h3>Reference Types</h3>
<p>Reference types are commonly referred to as <em>classes</em>, which is to say that when you have a reference value, you are dealing with an object.</p>

<h4>Let's look at some examples:</h4>
<pre>
<code>
var x = 35;
alert(x.toFixed(2)); //returns "35.00";

var y = new Number(42);
alert(y.toFixed(2)); //retuns "42.00";

alert(typeof x); //returns "number" (data is stored on the stack);
alert(typeof y); //returns "object" (data is stored on the heap);

alert(x instanceof Number); //returns "false";
alert(y instanceof Number); //returns "true";
</code>
</pre>
