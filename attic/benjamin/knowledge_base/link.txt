How do I create a link to a file?

According to O'Reilly Unix Power Tools (Article 19.04), 
hard links "point to the same inode and the same set of 
data blocks". Hard links point only to files (no directories)
and must reside in the same file system. 

Since a symbolic link is a separate inode from the object
it points to, it can point to other objects such as directories.
Also, a soft link can cross file systems. Use the ln command,
to create a soft link called "nptr" to the "/usr/eds/was" directory: 

ln -s /usr/eds/was nptr 

A broken link happens if the /usr/eds/was directory is deleted. 

Finally, according to the ln description in Unix in a Nutshell,
you can see a soft link with ls -l, but use find -inum to find
 a hard link.
