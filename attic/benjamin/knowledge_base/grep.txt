Q. How can I search for keywords within a file or directory?

A. Use the grep command.

For example, to search recursively for every instance of POST in the 
your web directory, type in the following at a shell prompt:

          grep -ir post /var/www/html

          i = case-insensitive
          r = recursively

          You can use the following as a template:

          grep [options] pattern [files] 

Oftentimes this will find many instances, and if you output the 
search to a file you can then look at it at you leisure.

          grep -ir post /var/www/html > my_grep.txt
