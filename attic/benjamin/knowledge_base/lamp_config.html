This is a very quick-and-dirty HOWTO for installing what's known as a 'LAMP' system: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
<br>
INITIAL STEPS
Most out-of-the-box Red Hat Linux installs will have one or more of these components installed via RPM files.  I 
personally believe in installing some things like this from source, so I get the most control over what's 
compiled in, what's left out, etc. But source code installs can wreak havoc if overlaid on top of RPM installs, 
as the two most likely won't share the same directories, etc.
<br>
If you have not yet installed your Linux OS, or just for future reference, do not choose to install Apache, PHP, 
or MySQL during the system installation. Then you can immediately proceed with the source-based install.
<br>
Note: to install applications from source code, you will need a compiler (gcc) installed.
<br><br>

<font size=5>1</font> Log in as 'root'
<br><br>
Because we will be installing software to directories that "regular" users don't have write access to, and 
also possibly uninstalling RPM versions of some applications, we'll log in as root. Yes, the only steps that 
need root access are the actual installation steps, but by doing the configure and make steps as root, the source 
code will also be inaccessible to "regular" users.

<br><br>

<font size=5>2</font> Remove RPM versions
<br><br>
Before we start with our source code install, we need to remove all the existing RPM files for these products. 
To find out what RPMs are already installed you will use the
<br>
rpm -qa
<br>
command in conjunction with grep to filter your results: 
<br><br>
rpm -qa | grep -i apache<br>
rpm -qa | grep -i php<br>
rpm -qa | grep -i mysql<br>
<br>
To remove the RPMs generated by these commands, do
<br>
rpm -e filename

<br><br>

<font size=5>3</font> Change to a "source" directory
<br><br>
We want to put all our source code someplace central, so it's not getting mixed up in someone's home directory, etc.
<br>
cd /usr/local/src

<br><br>

<font size=5>4</font> Get source code for all applications
<br><br>
One way application source code is distributed is in what are known as "tarballs." The tar command is usually 
associated with making tape backups - tar stands for Tape ARchive. It's also a handy way to pack up multiple files 
for easy distribution. Use the man tar command to learn more about how to use this very flexible tool.
<br>
Unpack all applications
<br>
Note that it is recommended that you install MySQL from RPMs, not from source.
<br><br>
rpm -ivh MySQL*<br>
tar zxvf php-5.0.1.tar.gz<br>
tar zxvf httpd_2.0.50.tar.gz
<br><br>

<font size=5>5</font> BUILD AND INSTALL APACHE (WITH DSO SUPPORT)
<br><br>
cd /usr/local/src/httpd_2.0.50<br>
./configure \<br>
--prefix=/usr/local/httpd \<br>
--enable-shared=max \<br>
--enable-module=rewrite \<br>
--enable-module=so<br>
<br>
make && make install

<br><br>

<font size=5>6</font> BUILD AND INSTALL PHP
<br><br>
Please note that there are many options which can be selected when compiling PHP. Some will have library dependencies, etc. You can use the command:
<br>
./configure --help | less
<br>
Once you change into the PHP source directory. This will show you a list of all possible configuration switches.
 For more information on what these switches are, please check the PHP website documentation.
<br>
cd /usr/local/src/php-5.0.1<br>
./configure \<br>
--with-apxs2=/usr/local/httpd/bin/apxs \<br>
--with-mysql=/usr \<br>
--enable-track-vars<br> 
<br>
This is just a minimal configuration.
<br><br>
NOTE:  If you get a warning about MySQL headers not being found you have to edit the directory that 
--with-mysql is pointing to.  For example, yours could look like '--with-mysql=/var/lib'.
<br><br>
make && make install
<br><br>
cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php.ini
<br><br>
[IF YOU DON'T COPY THE .INI THEN THE ZEND ENGINE CAN'T FIND YOUR FILE]

<br><br>

<font size=5>7</font> EDIT APACHE CONFIG FILE, START WEB SERVER
<br><br>
cd /usr/local/httpd/conf<br>
vi httpd.conf
<br>
Set up the Apache config file in accordance with Apache instructions (beyond the scope of this HOWTO).
<br>
To ensure your PHP files are properly interpreted, and not just downloaded as text files, remove the # 
at the beginning of the lines which read:
<br>
#AddType application/x-httpd-php .php<br>
#AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
<br><br>
If the AddType lines above don't exist, manually enter them after a line reading
<br>
AddType application/x-tar .tgz (or something similar)
<br>
or anyplace within the <IfModule mod_mime.c> section of httpd.conf.
<br><br>
If you wish to use other extensions on your file names instead of .php, add them to the AddType directive:
<br>
#AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml<br>
#AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps .phtmls
<br><br>
Add index.php to the list of valid Directory Index files so that your "homepage" can be named index.php:
<br>
<IfModule mod_dir.c>
    DirectoryIndex index.php index.htm index.html
</IfModule>
<br><br>
Make sure to change the DocumentRoot to /var/www/html and to create the 'www' and 'html' directories, if necessary.
<br><br>
Also, make sure that you change ServerName to whatever ip you are using.

<br><br>

<font size=5>8</font> START APACHE
<br><br>
/usr/local/httpd/bin/httpd -k start
<br>
<br>
