Q. Why isn't the Calvin fortune program displaying a witticism when
I log into my Red Hat box?

	Symptoms:

		1. The regular fortune is still 
		   displaying it's message.   
		2. There isn't any fortune.


A. You have to first install the regular fortune program and then 
edit a shell script.


I found that the Calvin program won't work unless the 'standard' fortune module 
is already installed on the system.  Once you've downloaded the RPM or source 
code for that program and have installed it, you must then alter a shell script 
if you only want the Calvin messages displayed upon login.  

*** If you want Linux to choose between regular fortunes and Calvin fortunes
each time you login, then you can leave 'as-is' and you're finished. ***

If you only want the Calvin fortunes displayed, then cd to the 
appropriate directory and edit the file.

	cd /etc/profile.d ; vi fortune.sh

Scroll down near the bottom of the file, and you should see this:

	echo ------------------------------------------
	fortune
	echo ------------------------------------------

Simply add 'calvin' after the word fortune, save the script,
and you're finished.
