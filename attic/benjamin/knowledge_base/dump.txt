You want to either move or archive the structure and data of several of your
database tables.

Q.  How do you do this?

Solution:

At the shell type the following:

mysqldump -h raffaello -u ben -p database_name table1 table2 table3 > my_db_dump.sql

It will then ask you for your password, and God willing you've got that handy, and 
you should be done.

You can then view the file with your favorite text editor.

-h = hostname 
-u = user
-p = prompt for password
