Q. When first attempting to start the vsftpd binary from the shell, I get
a '500 OOPS: could not bind listening IPv4 socket' error.  What am I doing wrong?

A. vsftpd is most likely started through the xinetd service (this is the default setting).

To check to see if this is indeed the case,
cd to /etc/xinetd.d and look for vsftpd.
If this file is present, use a text editor to change the value of disable to 'YES'.
You must then restart the xinetd daemon for this change to be effected:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart

After this command, you can then start the vsftpd binary from the shell,
and it should (hopefully) work.

/usr/local/sbin/vsftpd &

NOTE:  You must be logged as root to do this.
