Q.  How do I determine what is dependent upon a particular RPM?

A.  Use the command --whatrequires.

Syntax:

	rpm -q --whatrequires [rpm]

       	[rpm] = the RPM you're wanting to remove

If you need to uninstall a particular RPM, first uninstall
whatever RPM(s) was unearthed by this query.
