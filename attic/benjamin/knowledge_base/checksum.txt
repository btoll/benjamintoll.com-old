Q.  How do I verify that the source code I just downloaded hasn't been tampered with?

A.  Check the key signature using either the MD5 algorithm or GnuPG.

	
	1. The simplest solution is to issue the following command at the shell:

		md5sum [package]

	The MD5 algorithm is usually included in most Linux distributions and is native
	to some programming languages, such as PHP.


	2. Another solution would be to use GnuPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) tool.  For example, 
	to check the integrity of the Samba source tarball issue the following commands at 
	the shell:

		$ gpg --import samba-pubkey.asc
     		$ gunzip samba-release.tar.gz
     		$ gpg --verify samba-release.tar.asc
     		gpg: Signature made Tue 26 Nov 2002 07:12:04 PM CST using DSA key ID 2F87AF6F
     		gpg: Good signature from "Samba Distribution Verification Key "

	
		**Note** -- This assumes you have also downloaded both the public key and the
			    key specific to your release.
