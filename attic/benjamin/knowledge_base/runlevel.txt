Q.  How do I set/change the run-level of my machine?

Solution:

        As root (or as a member of the WHEEL group), enter the 
        following at the shell:

        cd /etc ; vi inittab

        # Default runlevel. The runlevels used by RHS are:
	#   0 - halt (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
	#   1 - Single user mode
	#   2 - Multiuser, without NFS (The same as 3, if you do not have networking)
	#   3 - Full multiuser mode
	#   4 - unused
	#   5 - X11
	#   6 - reboot (Do NOT set initdefault to this)
	#
	id:3:initdefault:

Simply change the number to suit your preference and then reboot the server.
