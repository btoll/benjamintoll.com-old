A.  You create a tarball.

	How to tar up a directory.

	-start in directory i want

		tar -cvzf foo.tgz *

		* = whatever i want to tar up
		c = create
		v = verbose
		z = gzip files before tarring them up
		f = the name of the file i'm creating


Q.  How do i unpack the tarball?

              -issue the following command at the shell:

                                tar zxvf foo.tgz

                                z = unzip
                                x = extract
                                v = verbose
                                f = filename


Here is the tar template:

              tar [options] [tarfile] [other-files]

Note that these are just some of the many options you may use with
tar.  For more search the tar man page.
