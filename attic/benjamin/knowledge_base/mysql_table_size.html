<font size="4">How big can my MySQL tables be?</font>

<br><br>

MySQL Version 3.22 had a 4 GB (4 gigabyte) limit on table size. With the MyISAM table type in MySQL Version 3.23, the maximum table size was increased to 8 million terabytes (2 ^ 63 bytes). With this larger allowed table size, the maximum effective table size for MySQL databases now normally is determined by operating system constraints on file sizes, not by MySQL internal limits.
