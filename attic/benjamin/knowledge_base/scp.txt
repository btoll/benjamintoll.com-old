Q.  How do I transfer files between computers when using SSH?

A.  Use scp, which is native to the SSH package.

To copy from the local machine to Athena:

  scp localfilename athena.dialup.mit.edu:/path/to/remotefilename

To copy from Athena to the local machine:

  scp athena.dialup.mit.edu:/path/to/remotefilename localfilename


To specify your Athena username (necessary if your username on the local machine is not the same as your Athena username):

  scp jqpublic@athena.dialup.mit.edu:/path/to/remotefilename localfilename
