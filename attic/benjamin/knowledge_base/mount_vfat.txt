Q.  How do I mount a Windows (vfat) partition/filesystem?

A.  You must edit the file that contains the mount information
and then create the mount point.


Do the following from the shell as the root user:

	vi /etc/fstab

	You must enter the info in the following order:

	(This is what my entry looks like to mount my Windows filesystem.)

		/dev/hda1   /mnt/win   vfat   noauto   0 0 

		
		DESCRIPTION:

		/dev/hda1 = the name of the device representing the filesystem
		/mnt/win  = the mount point in the file system
		vfat 	  = the files system type
		noauto    = an option to the mount command
		0	  = indicates whether or not the file system will be dumped
		0	  = indicates whether or not the file system needs to be checked with fsck


Next, you must create the mount point.

Simply do the following as root at the shell.

	mkdir /mnt/win

	You can then mount the vfat file system by typing

		mount /mnt/win

(For more information please see the fstab and mount man pages.)
