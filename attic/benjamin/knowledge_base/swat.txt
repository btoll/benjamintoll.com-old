I've compiled the Samba server from source and now I can't locate 
SWAT (Samba Web Administration Tool) and its binary.  Help!!


First, you must find where the binary is located in the file system.
Different Linux distributions will put this in different directories,
however you can usually find it in /usr/local/samba/sbin or some similarity.

Enter the following at the shell:

	find / -name swat

	For example, my search resulted in the following
	files and directories:

		/usr/local/samba/sbin/swat
		/usr/local/samba/swat

	A little investigation revealed that the binary is the former
	and the latter is a directory containing SWAT's support files.

	If you cd to the /usr/local/samba/sbin directory, the following 
	command reveals SWAT to be an ELF (Executable and Linking Format) 
	binary, the default binary format for Linux.

		file swat


Next, SWAT needs to be enabled for use.  It should be installed to run via
the network super-daemon, either inetd or xinetd depending on your system.

The control file should be located within the /etc/[x]inet[d].d directory.
If the SWAT file isn't in the directory then you must create it.  Here's how
the control file could look:

	# default: off
	# description:  SWAT is the Samba Web Admin Tool. Use swat \
	#		to configure your Samba server. To use SWAT, \
	#		connect to port 901 with your favorite web browser.
	service swat
	{
		port	= 901
		socket_type	= stream
		wait	= no
		only_from = localhost
		user	= root
		server	= /usr/local/samba/sbin/swat
		log_on_failure	+= USERID
		disable	= yes
	}


Note - If the server's directory path isn't where your SWAT binary is located then
you must change it to where it resides.  Also, you must enable SWAT by editing disable 
to equal no.

Restart the xinetd daemon:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart

You then should be able to go to Mozilla (or whatever) and enter your hostname followed
by the port that the daemon is listening to.

	localhost:901

If that doesn't work then you should verify your hostname.  Try this instead:

	127.0.0.1:901

If that doesn't work then RTFM.
