Several steps can be taken to secure the default mysql installation. 

1. Root Password

When you first install mysql, be it from a source tarball or from a RPM, you must set
the 'root' password. This is the password that can be used to control all of the tables,
mysql startup/shutdown, etc. To do this type the command; 

	mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'


2. Default Users and Tables

mysql also ships with two default users and default 'test' tables. The default users are
for connecting to the DBMS without specifying a password, so removing these users is obviously
a very good security measure. There are also entries so that tables called or starting with
'test' can be world-writable. These should also be disabled for obvious reasons. To do so, you
must first go into the DBMS: 

	mysql -u root -p mysql
	Enter password:
	Reading table information for completion of table and column names
	You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

	Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or g.
	Your MySQL connection id is 2 to server version: 4.0.16-standard

	Type 'help' for help.


3. Now we execute the two commands to delete the desired entries: 

	mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE User = '';
	mysql> DELETE FROM db WHERE Host = '%';


**Note** It is recommended not to maintain the MySQL server as the root user.
	 It is better to create a user with all privileges for this purpose.
